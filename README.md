[Advent of Code - 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) (link to site)


### Instructions:

 - An (informal) repo with scripts used for Advent of Code 2021. To keep things oranized the repo has the following structure:

```
|-- 2021
    |-- Day 1
        |-- day1_readme.txt
        |-- at_script_name1.R
        |-- ac_script_name1.py
        |-- Inputs
            |-- at_input_name1.txt
    |-- Day 2
        |-- day2_readme.txt
        |-- at_script_name2.R
        |-- lm_script_name2.py
        |-- Inputs
            |-- at_input_name2.txt
    |-- Day 3
    |-- Day 4
    ...
    |-- Day 25
|-- 2022
...
```

 - For clarity, let's also prefix our scripts with our initials (e.g., `at_script_name1.R` or `ast_script_name1.R` for me) and save each script in the respective day-folder
 - I will put the instructions (and link to the problem) in a text file in each folder
 - Inputs are unique to users, so you will not get the correct answer if you use somebody else's input file
 - We can update these instructions once we know what is useful. For now, this serves as a starting place for organizing this
 - Feel free to edit as you see fit! 

Note: I do not plan to dedicate much (if any) work-time to this, but wanted it on my work Github in-case it could ever be a coding resource for someone in the future.
